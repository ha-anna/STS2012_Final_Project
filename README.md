# ASL Signs Recognition System

This project was developed as a final project for the Deep Learning based Big
Data Processing Lab course during the Spring 2025 semester at Sogang University.
It was built by a team of three students ‚Äî The Overfitters.

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) signs using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to create a deep learning model
that can accurately classify hand gestures representing different ASL alphabet
letters.

We chose this topic because we wanted to work on something meaningful, socially
relevant, and that we find interesting. There are many areas in accessibility
that still need to be improved. Sign language allows humans to communicate
without sound, and plays a critical role in accessibility and communication for
the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. By exploring ASL sign detection,make
we wanted to understand how deep learning can be applied to improve inclusivity
and bridge communication gaps using computer vision.

What we have learned while working on this project:

- Model struggles with recognition of signs that look similar

## Getting started

### üîß Setup

You must first download the
[ASL(American Sign Language) Alphabet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashishsau/aslamerican-sign-language-aplhabet-dataset)
and place it in the `data` folder.

This project uses `poetry`, a tool for dependency management and packaging in
Python.Follow this tutorial to install it on your machine:
[Poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
make setup
```

This will:

- Configure Poetry to create the virtual environment inside the project (`.venv`
  folder)
- Install all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`

**Note:** You don‚Äôt need to manually activate the virtual environment. Use
`poetry run` or `make` commands which automatically run inside it.

### üö® Managing Dependencies (Add or Remove Packages)

**Important:** Always use Poetry commands to add or remove dependencies, never
use pip install directly. This keeps your `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`
files consistent.

To add a new package:

```
make add-dep PACKAGE=package_name

```

Example:

```
make add-dep pkg=numpy

```

This runs poetry add requests under the hood and updates your lock file
automatically.

To remove a package:

```
make remove-dep pkg=requests

```

### üì¶ Install Dependencies (if .venv already exists)

```
make install
```

This installs all required Python packages.

### üß† Train the CNN Model

```
make train
```

This runs the training script located at src/cnn/cnn.py. It prepares the data
and trains a CNN model on selected ASL classes.

### üßë‚Äçü¶∞ Run Face Recognition

```
make run

```

This runs the sign recognition script located at
src/sign_recognition/sign_recognition.py.

The webcam view can be exited with `q`.

### üßπ Code Formatting (Linting)

```
make lint
```

This formats your code using black and isort for clean, consistent style.

### üìå Freeze Dependencies

```
make freeze

```

Updates poetry.lock to lock the current dependency versions.

### Project Intro

```
make intro
```

This creates an ASCII art in terminal displaying the project name and the team
name.
